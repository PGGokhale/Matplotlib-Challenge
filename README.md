# Matplotlib Challenge
This repository is created to work on Matplotlib homework.

* It consists of a folder "Pymaceuticals" which has the jupyter notebook, output plots and the Data.
Following four plots are created using provided data about four different Cancer Medicines and their impact on the Cancer.
  * Tumor volume change over time for each treatment
  * Metastatic (cancer spreading) sites change over time for each treatment.
  * A plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
  * A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
* The Report_Observations_Pymaceuticals.pdf contains the observations drawn by studying the output plots.
